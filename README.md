# Networking
1.what is Networking?
  Also called computer network, it is 2 or more devices need to/sharing info between them.
  to do that,they need a common media between them to share that info.
  
2.Network Types:
  - LAN[local area network
  some users in the same room/department connected using a switch devices.
  some userrs in diff rooms/dept connected using router and switches.
  -WAN[ wide area network]
  service provider will be needed
  A group of router swiches and other devices will be needed.

3.Network components-=:

  1.Routers- Network devices that connect diff network domains and routes the ip packets to its correct destinations.'
   - asr-1000 -not used now/removed by cisco 
   - asr-9000
   - c-8000
   - ncs-5
     each interface is broadcast domain.

  2.swiches: network devices that connects 2 or more devices in one network domain.
   -c-9000
   -c3000
   -c-8500 old
   -c-6500
   -c-2000

  -then what is multi-layer switch?mls,l3switch?
diff b/w router nd switches , port density [s-more]

  3.Firewalls and intrution prevention system-
   -Firewall proctects you from the intenet, apply some restricitions to your local net.

   - IPS do deep packet inspection[dps] try to spot attacks.

   - There are 2 in 1 sol- NGFW[ next gen firewalls]= fw+ ips

4.acccess point- like swiches, APs are the (wireless) destination for a host to comunicate with other hosts.
5.Controllers- 
          A- wireless controllers: a central management point for multiple aps
          B- cisco dna center: the super powerful, super caapble central point of manangement for analystics, automation,using gui to design,display and config.

6.servers- a device, storing common data for users to make use of
        as a hardware matter, it is a computer! but with high capablities
        while clients are the end devices that consumes or generated new data
